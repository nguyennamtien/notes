h3. @CFURLWriteDataAndPropertiesToResource(/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist) failed: -10@

You somehow called (or something similar)

bc. $ apachectl stop

expecting it will use the macports installation and run @/opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl@ . Unfortunately the Apache installation of OS X is first in the @PATH@. To control the pre-installed Apache its better to use @System Preferences > Sharing > Web-Sharing@.

h2. Installation

h3. OSX

bc. $ wget http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flex/sdk/flex_sdk_3.5.zip
$ sudo cp -r flex_sdk_3 /Developer/SDKs/


Add it to the path by editing your @.profile@

bc. export PATH="/Developer/SDKs/flex_sdk_3/bin:$PATH"/

If you have the Flex Builder installed, the SDK should be found under @/Developer/SDKs/flex_sdk_3@. Just add it to the path in that case.

h2. Data Bindings

h3. Bindable

If you use @[Bindable]@ on your class (or on the respective fields/methods) make sure that the instance of the class is also marked as @[Bindable]@.

h2. FAQ/Problems

h3. Invalid Embed directive in stylesheet - can't resolve source 'Embed("/assets/path/file.png")'.

This can be a pain. You might try clearing the cache, cleaning the project, deleting your files in the @bin@ directory but still run into this error.

The cause was not the css file but a custom component using an Embed statement. In this statement a graphic resource has been referenced that wasn't there yet. For some reasons Flex Builder spews the above errors first but the root cause later

bc. unable to resolve '/assets/path/file2.png' for transcoding	project/components	Component.mxml	line 224	1263378739408	3433

If you try to resolve your compile error from top to bottom, you won't see the error and, even worse, if you have more than 100 Embed directives in your css file you won't even see the other error message, as Flex Builder per default only shows the first 100 error messages.

To show more error messages use the white triangle on the top right corner in the problems pane and choose @Preferences...@ to change the 	number of errors.

# Motivation #

This is taken directly from a post of [ZenHabits](http://zenhabits.net/) called "[10 Ways to Beat the Can’t Get No Satisfaction Syndrome](http://zenhabits.net/2009/02/10-ways-to-beat-the-cant-get-no-satisfaction-syndrome/)" written by Leo Babauta. I liked it so much that I put it here:

1.  **Make small, positive changes**. This is a bit of a paradox.
    Making small, positive changes — eating a little healthier,
    exercising a little, creating some small productive habits, for
    example — are an amazing way to get excited about life … but
    doesn’t it take some excitement and motivation to even get
    started with these small changes? Yes, a little … but not a lot.
    If you start small, you don’t need a lot of motivation. Just get
    going. You’ll soon find that just the act of getting started and
    doing something will give you some momentum, and soon you’ll be
    in a positive spiral of changes — one building on the other.
    When I started doing this in my life, I was so excited I had to
    start Zen Habits to share it with the world.
2.  **Banish negative thinking**. Negative thoughts are the bane of an
    exciting existence. You can’t have all these negative thoughts,
    and hope to really enjoy life. It’s one or the other — and
    it’s your choice. Do you want to think negative — I can’t do
    it, this sucks — or do you want to love life and do amazing
    things and get excited about everything? It really is a choice.
    And it takes awareness — be aware of your thoughts and when you
    catch yourself thinking negative, squash the thought like a bug,
    and replace it with a positive thought. Seriously, it works. I did
    this with running and smoking when I first started, and I was able
    to successfully start running and quit smoking. That was more than
    three years ago, and I haven’t smoked since and I’ve run three
    marathons since then. All because I banished negative thoughts.
3.  **Look at the wonderful side of things**. This is kinda the flip
    side of No. 2 above, but I don’t care — it’s so important I
    need to give it its own list item. Yes, that’s right — it
    matters that much: everything around you has a wonderful side, and
    you just need to look at that to realize how lucky you are.
    Seriously. My internet went down? That’s a wonderful thing: I
    was more productive than ever before, plus I spent more time with
    my kids rather than surfing the web. My daughter is throwing a
    tantrum because she wants a toy her brother is playing with?
    It’s a wonderful opportunity for me to teach her about sharing,
    to invent some fun new activity we can do together, to spend some
    time with my kids. My grandfather died? It’s a wonderful chance
    for me to celebrate the great life he led, the influence he had on
    me and those around me, to learn more about him, to spend time
    with friends and family, to reflect on the preciousness of life.
4.  **Exercise**. Not everyone is a fan of exercise, but I can tell
    you firsthand that it can work miracles. While many people do it
    to improve their appearance, there’s so much more to exercise
    — it can be incredibly fun while you’re doing it (if you do it
    right), you feel healthy and energetic, you can get a fresh
    insight into your life and life in general. When I exercise, I
    feel so much better than those days when I don’t. It gives me
    new ideas, time to contemplate, time to spend with my sister (who
    is my friend and running partner). Start with just 10 minutes a
    day and you’ll see how much it can energize your life.
5.  **Appreciate loved ones**. It’s not a secret that I’m a big
    fan of spending time with my family. It’s my No. 1 favorite
    pastime. And for good reason: when I do so, I love life so much
    more. Even just laying on the couch reading together, or renting a
    movie and eating take-out food, or walking along the beach
    together, or cracking jokes with each other — it really makes
    life so much better. Take the time to appreciate your loved ones,
    and if you haven’t spent time with them lately, do so today if
    you can! At the very least, give your loved ones a call or send a
    nice email.
6.  **Pursue a passion**. This was a life-changer for me. For many
    years, I was too afraid or too pessimistic to pursue my passion
    (writing) seriously. In January 2007, I started Zen Habits as a
    way to pursue that passion, and it was one of the best decisions
    of my life (my wife and children being the others). Even if I
    didn’t make money from blogging, I’d love it and it would be
    worth doing just for the energy it infuses into my life. Whatever
    your passion, pursue it with energy. If you don’t know what that
    passion is, you need to start exploring and trying new things —
    it could take awhile, but it’s worth the effort.
7.  **Talk and work with other excited people**. Boy, this is really a
    great one. I wish someone had told me about this a decade ago.
    I’ve worked with competent people before, but looking back on
    it, often they were jaded or cynical or negative in some way. And
    these negative, bored people would have an effect on my attitude.
    But the times when I’ve worked with people who are excited about
    what they do … well, I’d get excited too. Even today, when I
    basically work alone, I collaborate with other great bloggers,
    with others on some cool projects … and I seek out people who
    get excited about what they do. It’s fun to work with them, and
    it makes things much more exciting.
8.  **Take time to recharge**. Sometimes you just feel drained, and
    you can’t get excited about anything. This is a good time to
    take a break if you can, to get out of your usual setting and your
    usual routine. You don’t have to go to the Caribbean or Guam
    (although if you can, that’s great) … just get out into
    nature, reflect on life, realize how wonderful it is, do some
    journaling or sketching, create, have fun, relax, do nothing. When
    you’re done, you’ll feel much better about everything, and
    come at things with a fresh perspective.
9.  **Get great feedback**. One of the things I love about blogging
    here at Zen Habits is the amazing feedback and encouragement I get
    from my readers. It has made blogging a joy, and the feedback I
    get has helped me to improve every step of the way. I get excited
    about what I do because I love the feedback — both the praise
    and the constructive criticism. I don’t love the hateful
    comments, but those are rare. While not everyone will become a
    blogger, it’s great if you can get some great feedback from
    people — coworkers, peers, friends and family, clients and
    customers. The more, the better. When you get negative feedback,
    use it to get better. When you get praise, bask in it and be
    grateful.
10. **Help others**. I don’t pretend that I’m the world’s
    greatest philanthropist, but often I get emails and comments from
    people who have improved their lives from what I’ve done. And
    the feeling I get from comments like this is unbelievable. I am
    incredibly grateful to be able to help others, even in a small
    way, and I highly recommend it to everyone. Even if your main job
    isn’t dedicated to helping others, find spare time to do
    volunteer charity work or find ways to do nice things to help your
    loved ones. It’ll make life so much better.

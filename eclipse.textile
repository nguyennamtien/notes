h2. Configuration

Some default settings are weird, especially the encoding and line delimiter settings. Keep them consistent within your development team.

* Deactivate Spell Checking. @General > Editors > Text Editors > Spelling@
* Refresh source tree automatically @Preferences > General > Workspace > Refresh Automatically@
* Change encoding @General -> Workspace > Text File Encoding -> Other -> UTF-8@
* Line Delimiter to Unix @General -> Workspace -> New text file line delimiter -> Other -> Unix@

h2. Hints

h3. Show hidden (@.*@) files

In the project explorer there is a small triangle or arrow facing down. Pressing it will open the _View Menu_. Choose @Customize View > Filters@ and deselect @.*-resources@ 

h3. Convert "General Project" to "Java Project" by adding Java Nature

Eclipse doesn't seem to offer a GUI variant of changing adding the nature of a project. You can do it manually by opening the relevant @.project@ file and add (or change it to, if it is already there)

bc. <natures>
	<nature>org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature</nature>
</natures>

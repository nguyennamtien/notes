# rsync #

    rsync -rv
    rsync -arvz

r (recursive)
:   copies directories and sub directories

v (verbose)
:   prints on the screen what is being copied, increase verbosity by adding more `v`, like `-vv` or `-vvv`

a (archive)
:   symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc. are preserved

z (compressed)
:   data will be compressed over the network

To copy the contents of `path` to `/volume/path/`

    $ rsync -r /path/ /volume/path/

To copy the folder `path` and its contents to `/volume/path` (it will create the folder: path):

    $ rsync -r /path /volume/path

Without the final slash, rsync will copy the directory in its entirety. With the trailing slash, it will copy the contents of the directory but wonâ€™t recreate the directory

Exclude files by adding patterns, for example you can exclude hidden files ba adding

    --exclude=".*/"

rsync even has an built in option to exclude `cvs` or `svn` files, just add

    --cvs-exclude

## Useful examples ##

Copy files from `path` to `backup` deleting files that don't exist on the sending side, ignoring `.git`

	rsync -arvz --delete --exclude=.git /path /backup
